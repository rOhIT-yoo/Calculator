This project is a GUI Mathematical Calculator application developed using the Custom Tkinter library. 
The calculator has a content area that displays the calculator interface, which supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentials. 
Furthermore, it features with built in calculus solver and Graphing method which is very useful tool. The application also includes a history feature that displays a log of previous calculations. 
The calculator connects to a MySQL database to store the history of calculations. 
The code includes functions for creating the menu buttons, displaying the calculator interface, handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying the calculation history. 
The application also includes error handling for syntax errors and exceptions. 
Overall, this project provides a user-friendly and feature-rich calculator application that can be used for various mathematical calculations and has the added benefit of storing a history of calculations for future reference.

TO RUN THE CODE FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW:
1.DOWNLOAD THE ATTACHED IMAGES AND COPY PASTE THE PATH IN THE CODE (__INIT__ PART) RESPECTIVELY.
2.CREATE A DATABASE NAMED "History" IN MySQL.
3.REPLACE THE PASSWORD IN THE DATABASE CONNECTION PART.
